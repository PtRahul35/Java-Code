public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String [] args ) {
        System.out.println(57);
    }
}


/* Here's a simple explanation of the "Hello World" Java program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **public class HelloWorld {**:
   - This line defines a public class named `HelloWorld`.
   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it contains methods (functions) and attributes (variables).

2. **public static void main(String[] args) {**:
   - This line defines the `main` method.
   - The `main` method is the entry point of any Java application. When you run the program, the code inside this method is executed first.
   - `public` means the method is accessible from anywhere.
   - `static` means this method belongs to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class.
   - `void` means the method does not return any value.
   - `String[] args` is an array of strings that stores command-line arguments. This parameter is not used in this simple program, but it's part of the method signature.

3. **System.out.println("Hello, World!");**:
   - This line prints the text `Hello, World!` to the console.
   - `System` is a built-in class that provides access to the system.
   - `out` is a static member of the `System` class, which represents the standard output stream (usually the console).
   - `println` is a method of the `out` object, which prints the given string to the console followed by a new line.

4. **}**:
   - These closing braces mark the end of the `main` method and the `HelloWorld` class, respectively.

### Summary

When you run this program, it executes the `main` method, which prints `Hello, World!` to the console. This is often the first program written by people learning a new programming language as it demonstrates the basic structure of a program and how to output text. */
