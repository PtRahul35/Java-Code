/*A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into a single unit. A class provides the structure and behavior that the objects created from it will have.

Key Components of a Class
Fields (Attributes/Variables): These are data members of the class that hold the state or properties of an object.
Methods: These define the behavior or functionality of the class.
Constructor: This is a special method used to initialize objects of the class.
How to Construct a Class in Java
To construct a class in Java, you need to:

Define the class: Use the class keyword followed by the class name.
Declare fields: Define the variables that represent the properties of the class.
Define methods: Implement the functions that define the behavior of the class.
Create a constructor: Define a constructor to initialize the object.
Example
Let's create a simple class Car with fields, methods, and a constructor. */

// Define the Car class
class Car {
    // Fields (Variables)
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Constructor to initialize the Car object
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display the car details
    public void displayCarInfo() {
        System.out.println("Make: " + make + ", Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }

    // Method to start the car
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("The car is starting...");
    }

    // Method to stop the car
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("The car is stopping...");
    }
}

// Main class to run the program
public class ClaMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Car object
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);

        // Display car details
        myCar.displayCarInfo(); // Outputs: Make: Toyota, Model: Corolla, Year: 2020

        // Start the car
        myCar.start(); // Outputs: The car is starting...

        // Stop the car
        myCar.stop(); // Outputs: The car is stopping...
    }
}

/*Explanation
Class Definition (Car):

The class is defined using the class keyword followed by the class name (Car).
The class contains three fields: make, model, and year. These fields represent the properties of a car.
Constructor:

The constructor public Car(String make, String model, int year) is used to initialize the fields when a new Car object is created. The constructor name is the same as the class name and it does not have a return type.
Methods:

displayCarInfo(): This method prints the car's make, model, and year.
start(): This method prints a message indicating the car is starting.
stop(): This method prints a message indicating the car is stopping.
Main Class (Main):

The Main class contains the main method, which is the entry point of the program.
Inside the main method, a new Car object (myCar) is created with the make "Toyota", model "Corolla", and year 2020.
The displayCarInfo(), start(), and stop() methods are called on the myCar object to demonstrate the functionality of the Car class.
Summary
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
A class in Java is constructed using the class keyword followed by the class name.
It includes fields (to store data), methods (to perform operations), and constructors (to initialize objects).
Objects are instances of classes and are created using the new keyword followed by a call to the constructor. */

/*Sure! Let's break down the code step by step and explain it in simple terms.

### Car Class

The `Car` class is a blueprint for creating car objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of a car.

1. **Fields (Variables)**:
   - `private String make;`
   - `private String model;`
   - `private int year;`

   These are the properties of a car. They are private, which means they can't be accessed directly from outside the class.

2. **Constructor**:
   ```java
   public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
       this.make = make;
       this.model = model;
       this.year = year;
   }
   ```
   The constructor is a special method that initializes the car's properties when a new `Car` object is created. It takes three parameters (`make`, `model`, and `year`) and assigns them to the corresponding fields.

3. **Methods**:
   - `displayCarInfo()`: This method prints out the car's details (make, model, and year).
     ```java
     public void displayCarInfo() {
         System.out.println("Make: " + make + ", Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
     }
     ```
   - `start()`: This method prints a message indicating that the car is starting.
     ```java
     public void start() {
         System.out.println("The car is starting...");
     }
     ```
   - `stop()`: This method prints a message indicating that the car is stopping.
     ```java
     public void stop() {
         System.out.println("The car is stopping...");
     }
     ```

### ClaMain Class

The `ClaMain` class contains the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

1. **Main Method**:
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // Create a Car object
       Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);

       // Display car details
       myCar.displayCarInfo(); // Outputs: Make: Toyota, Model: Corolla, Year: 2020

       // Start the car
       myCar.start(); // Outputs: The car is starting...

       // Stop the car
       myCar.stop(); // Outputs: The car is stopping...
   }
   ```
   - **Create a Car object**: `Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);`
     This line creates a new `Car` object with the make "Toyota", model "Corolla", and year 2020. The `Car` constructor is called to initialize these values.

   - **Display car details**: `myCar.displayCarInfo();`
     This line calls the `displayCarInfo` method on the `myCar` object, which prints out the car's make, model, and year.

   - **Start the car**: `myCar.start();`
     This line calls the `start` method on the `myCar` object, which prints a message indicating that the car is starting.

   - **Stop the car**: `myCar.stop();`
     This line calls the `stop` method on the `myCar` object, which prints a message indicating that the car is stopping.

### Summary

- **Class Definition**: The `Car` class defines the properties and behaviors of a car.
- **Fields**: The properties of the car (make, model, year) are stored in private variables.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the car's properties when a new `Car` object is created.
- **Methods**: Define the behaviors of the car (displaying information, starting, stopping).
- **Main Class**: The `ClaMain` class contains the `main` method, where a `Car` object is created and its methods are called to display its information, start, and stop it.

This example shows how to define a class in Java, create an object from the class, and use its methods to perform actions. */
